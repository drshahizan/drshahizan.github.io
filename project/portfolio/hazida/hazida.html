    <h3>Radio Access Planner</h3>
    <p>Ericsson (M) Sdn Bhd,Selangor, Malaysia</p>
    <p><i>May 2018 - Present</i></p><br>
    <p>Designing and optimizing the wireless network infrastructure of a telecommunications company. Main focus is on the radio access network (RAN) that enables wireless communication between users and the network.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network Design: Involved in designing and planning the radio access network architecture, which includes determining the location and configuration of base stations, antennas, and other network elements. Analyze coverage requirements, traffic patterns, and user demand to ensure efficient network deployment.</li>
        <li>Frequency Allocation: Allocate radio frequencies for different wireless technologies, such as GSM, CDMA, or LTE, based on the available spectrum and regulatory requirements. The frequency spectrum is carefully manage to minimize interference and optimize network performance.</li>
        <li>Capacity Planning: Assess network capacity requirements and plan for future growth. Analyze traffic patterns, user behavior, and network performance data to determine the optimal number of base stations, cell sizes, and other network parameters to meet user demand.</li>
        <li>Interference Management: Managing interference is crucial for maintaining a reliable wireless network. Radio access planners employ various techniques, such as frequency planning, power control, and interference cancellation, to minimize interference and improve signal quality.</li>
        <li>Network Expansion and Upgrades: As technology evolves and user demands increase, radio access planners are responsible for planning network expansions and upgrades. They assess the need for additional base stations, new technologies, or capacity enhancements to accommodate growing traffic and provide superior network performance.</li>
        <li>Collaboration and Coordination: Radio access planners collaborate with different teams, including network engineers, site acquisition teams, and regulatory authorities, to ensure smooth network deployment and compliance with regulations. They also coordinate with equipment vendors to evaluate new technologies and solutions for network improvement.</li>
