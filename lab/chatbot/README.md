# Chatbot Project Setup Guide

If you encounter an error like "API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key." while chatting with the chatbot, please follow these steps:

## Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Navigate to the API key section and create a new API key.

Your API key will look something like this: AIzaSyAtpnKGX13bTgmx0l_gQeatYvdWvY_wOTQ

**Note:** The API is free but has a limited number of usage requests.

## Insert Your API Key

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Locate to the `script.js` file in your project.
3. Find the `API_KEY` variable and replace `PASTE-YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual API key.

## Save and Test

1. Save the `script.js` file after adding your API key.
2. Open` index.html` in your browser to verify that Chatbot is working correctly.
